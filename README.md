# Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system using machine learning models. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, reducing financial losses for individuals and institutions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).

## Machine Learning Models
Three machine learning models were implemented to detect fraudulent transactions:
1. Logistic Regression:
A simple and widely used classification model that predicts the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on a set of input features.
2. Decision Tree:
A tree-based model that uses a hierarchical structure to classify transactions as fraudulent or not.
3. Random Forest:
An ensemble learning model that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of fraud detection.

## Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy scores, with the following results:

Model	Accuracy

Logistic Regression:	0.99

Decision Tree:	0.99

Random Forest:	0.99
